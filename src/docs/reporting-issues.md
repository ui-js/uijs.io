# Reporting Issues

## Contributing Ideas and Feature Requests

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/issues) to submit
requests for new features. First, have a look at what might already be there,
and if you don't see anything that matches, write up a new issue.

If you do see something similar to your idea, comment on it or add a üëç.

## Contributing Issues

If you're running into some problems using MathLive or something doesn't
behave the way you think it should, please file an issue in GitHub.

Before filing something, at the existing issues. Avoid filing duplicates, but you can
add a comment to an existing issue if you'd like.

### What happens after I file an issue?

-   Once a developer has started working on the bug, the bug will be assigned to someone.
-   Once a bug has been resolved, it is closed. You can still comment on closed bugs, or re-open them if necessary.

In addition, issues can be tagged with the following:

-   _high priority_: Catastrophic issue that impacts many users
-   _medium priority_: Regression or issues that impact a significant number of users
-   _low priority_: Low severity (minor cosmetic issue) or very few users impacted
-   _no priority_: No plan to fix the issue, but we will consider a fix if someone offers a pull request
-   _good first issue_: This is an issue that would be a good candidate for someone
    who has little experience with the code base
-   _external_: This is an issue that has a dependency on an external component
    (typically, a browser)
-   _architecture_: This is an issue that requires a significant architectural
    change
-   _performance_: This issue affects perceived or measurable performance
-   _cleanup_: Resolving this issue would improve the code base maintainability
    without adding new functionality
-   _unable to reproduce_ the bug, as reported, could not be replicated
    by the developer. Additional information is necessary to continue investigating.
-   _not a bug_: The behavior described in the issue report is actually
    the intended behavior. This may be a usability issue, a documentation issue,
    or a disagreement regarding what the behavior should be.
-   _fact of life_: The issue cannot be resolved due to constraints of
    the browser, the OS, or the laws of physics.
