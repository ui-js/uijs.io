<p>Hi!</p>
<p> I’m Arno and I’ve always been interested in typography and in math as a
     language. At the intersection of science and art, I have crafted MathLive: 
     math input made easy.
</p>

<p>When you type a formula, MathLive will typeset it beautifully, as TeX would 
    have and generate the LaTeX and MathML markup for it</p>

<p>MathLive is a Javascript library that implements the TeX layout algorithms 
using modern HTML/CSS. It implements a large set 
of LaTeX commands, including some popular extensions used by MathJAX. 
It is tested on all modern browsers, on both desktop and mobile devices. 
It has a rich API that allows extensive customization and extensibility. 
You can find out more in the MathLive Usage Guide.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what you will do with it. Enjoy!</p>
